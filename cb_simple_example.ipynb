    "This exercise guides you through the creation of an extremely simple and essential energy model. It consists in one simplified electricity supply chain, with one electricity demand (growing between the years 2019 and 2022), coal power plant capacity to meet that demand, and coal extraction to feed the coal power plants. The chain is represented in the figure.\n",
