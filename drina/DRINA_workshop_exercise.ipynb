    "Under the framework of the Drina Nexus assessment an integrated water-energy model for the Drina countries was developed. The model represents the electricity system of the riparian countries, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Republic of Serbia and, in an aggregated fashion, electricity transmission infrastructure among the riparian countries and between them and neighbouring countries. The part of the model representing hydropower generation inside the basin is based on simplified modelling of the hydroelectric power plants and dams in the Drina River and its tributaries. This is done to ensure that water flows and constraints imposed on the electricity generation are properly represented. A long-term energy investment optimization model that calculates the least-cost energy supply mix to meet the electricity demands (built with the modelling framework OSeMOSYS) is used. \n",
